# Version 1.0 Deployment Guide - Direct SEC API

## 🎯 Quick Deployment to Vercel

Version 1.0 uses **direct SEC API integration** without MCP. This is simpler and faster to deploy.

## Required Environment Variables for Vercel

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

### 1. SEC Compliance (REQUIRED)
```bash
SEC_USER_AGENT=EdgarAnswerEngine/1.0 (brett.vantil@crowe.com)
```

### 2. Database (Optional - for caching)
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-or-postgres-connection-string
```

### 3. Redis (Optional - for rate limiting)
```bash
REDIS_URL=your-upstash-or-redis-connection-string
```

### 4. OpenAI (REQUIRED for chat responses)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### 5. Application Config
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** ✅ (Already done)
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect Vercel to GitHub**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Select `brettvtcrowe/edgar-query`

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the variables above
   - Most important: `SEC_USER_AGENT` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`

4. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy from main branch
   - Or click "Redeploy" to trigger manually

## ✅ What Works in Version 1.0

- ✅ Company queries (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- ✅ Filing retrieval with direct SEC links
- ✅ Form type display (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
- ✅ Natural language responses via GPT-4
- ✅ Citations with clickable SEC document URLs

## ❌ What Doesn't Work Yet (Version 2.0)

- ❌ Deep content extraction from filings
- ❌ Cross-company thematic analysis
- ❌ Financial calculations
- ❌ Advanced MCP tools

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app/api/chat

# Test query
curl -X POST https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What was the latest filing from AAPL?"}]}'
```

## 📊 Expected Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "pattern": "company-specific",
  "answer": "Apple's most recent SEC filing is a Form 8-K filed on [date]...",
  "citations": [
    {
      "title": "Form 8-K - 2025-01-15",
      "url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000008/aapl-20250115.htm",
      "form": "8-K",
      "filingDate": "2025-01-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔗 Key Features

### Direct SEC Document Links
Every filing returned includes a clickable URL to the actual SEC document:
- Format: `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{CIK}/{ACCESSION}/{DOCUMENT}`
- Works for all forms: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.
- No more "undefined form" errors

### Intelligent Form Detection
- Handles both `form` and `formType` field names
- Fallback to "Unknown Form" if neither exists
- Clean display in chat responses

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "undefined form" Error
✅ **FIXED** - The code now handles both `form` and `formType` fields

### Missing SEC Links
✅ **FIXED** - Citations now include direct SEC.gov URLs

### Rate Limiting
- SEC API allows 10 requests/second
- Built-in rate limiting in the client
- Redis optional for distributed rate limiting

## 📈 Version 1.0 vs Version 2.0

| Feature | Version 1.0 (Now) | Version 2.0 (Future) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Company Info | ✅ Basic | ✅ Enhanced |
| Filing Lists | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

| Content Extraction | ❌ No | ✅ Full text + sections |
| Financial Analysis | ❌ No | ✅ 21 MCP tools |
| Cross-Company | ❌ No | ✅ Thematic search |
| Deployment | ✅ Simple (Vercel only) | ⚠️ Complex (Vercel + GCP) |

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your Version 1.0 deployment is successful when:
1. ✅ Chat API returns company data
2. ✅ Form types display correctly (not "undefined")
3. ✅ Citations include clickable SEC.gov URLs
4. ✅ Natural language responses via GPT-4

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to GitHub
- Use Vercel's environment variable encryption
- SEC_USER_AGENT must include valid email
- Rate limits prevent API abuse

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Deploy Version 1.0 to Vercel (simple, works now)
2. Test with real queries
3. Gather user feedback
4. Plan Version 2.0 with MCP integration (complex, later)
