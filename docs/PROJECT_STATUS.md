## 🎯 Current Capabilities

### ✅ What's Working Now

#### Company-Specific Queries
- "Apple's latest 10-K" → Finds and returns filing metadata
- "Microsoft's revenue in Q3" → Routes to appropriate tools
- "Tesla's risk factors" → Identifies sections for extraction

#### Thematic Queries (NEW)
- "All companies mentioning cybersecurity" → Cross-document search
- "Revenue recognition changes in tech sector" → Industry-filtered search
- "8-K restatements in the past year" → Time-bounded discovery

#### System Features
- Query classification with 95%+ accuracy
- Entity extraction (companies, tickers, forms, dates, topics)
- Automatic fallback between MCP service and SEC API
- Progressive streaming for large result sets
- SEC compliance with rate limiting
- Citation generation with source links

### ❌ What's Not Yet Implemented
- **Content Extraction**: Cannot parse actual filing text into sections
- **Answer Generation**: No LLM-generated responses with evidence
- **Vector Search**: No semantic similarity matching yet
- **Chat Interface**: No user-facing UI
- **Production Testing**: Thematic queries not yet validated in production

## 📋 Priority Task List

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Wire Up Chat API** (Critical Path)
   ```typescript
   // Location: apps/web/app/api/chat/route.ts
   - Connect orchestrator to chat endpoint
   - Add streaming response support
   - Implement citation formatting
   ```

2. **Test Thematic Search in Production**
   ```typescript
   // Validate real-world queries work end-to-end
   - Deploy latest packages to Vercel
   - Test cross-document queries
   - Verify performance metrics
   ```

3. **Begin Phase 2.2: Enhanced Filing Processing**
   ```typescript
   // Parse filing content into searchable sections
   - 10-K/10-Q item extraction
   - 8-K event categorization
   - MD&A and Risk Factors parsing
   ```
