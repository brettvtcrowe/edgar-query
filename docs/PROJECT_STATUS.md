# Current Status: Built and tested locally
# Next Steps:
1. Deploy to Railway with Dockerfile
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up CORS and authentication
4. Test from external network
```

### 2. Build Vercel Client (Day 2)
```typescript
// Create: packages/edgar-client/
// Purpose: Connect Vercel app to MCP service
interface EdgarClient {
  callMCPTool(name: string, args: any): Promise<Result>
  fallbackToDirectAPI(): Promise<Result>
}
```

### 3. Query Orchestration (Day 3)
```typescript
// Create: packages/query-orchestrator/
// Purpose: Route queries to appropriate system
classifyQuery(query: string): {
  type: 'company' | 'thematic',
  confidence: number
}
```

### 4. Custom Thematic Tools (Days 4-5)
```typescript
// Create: packages/thematic-search/
// Purpose: Cross-document search capabilities
bulkFilingDiscovery(params): AsyncIterator<Filing>
crossDocumentSearch(query): SearchResults
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Current Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (Vercel)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector (Neon)
- **Cache**: Redis (Upstash)
- **Storage**: Vercel Blob
- **MCP Integration**: Docker + HTTP Bridge
- **Language**: TypeScript throughout

### Service Architecture:
```
Vercel App ‚Üí HTTP Client ‚Üí Railway MCP Service ‚Üí Docker MCP ‚Üí SEC EDGAR
     ‚Üì                           ‚Üì
Fallback to Direct SEC API   Health Monitoring
```

## üìÅ Key Files and Locations

### Working Code:
- `services/edgar-mcp-http-bridge/` - HTTP bridge service (READY)
- `packages/types/` - Shared types and utilities (READY)
- `packages/types/src/edgar-mcp-client.ts` - Docker MCP client (WORKING)

### Documentation:
- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Full development roadmap
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md` - Technical architecture
- `docs/completed/` - Phase completion records
- `docs/EDGAR_MCP_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Deployment strategy

### Test Files:
- `services/edgar-mcp-http-bridge/src/test-bridge.ts` - HTTP bridge tests
- `packages/types/src/simple-test.ts` - Direct MCP tests

## üöÄ Quick Commands

### Start HTTP Bridge Locally:
```bash
cd services/edgar-mcp-http-bridge
npm install
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

### Test HTTP Bridge:
```bash
# In another terminal:
npm run test-bridge
# Should see 5/5 tests passing
```

### Test Direct MCP:
```bash
cd packages/types
npx tsx src/simple-test.ts
# Tests all 21 EDGAR MCP tools
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Docker Platform Warning
- **Warning**: AMD64 image on ARM64 Mac
- **Impact**: Performance slower but functional
- **Solution**: Works fine, just slower on M1/M2 Macs

### Issue 2: MCP Protocol Handshake
- **Problem**: Must send `notifications/initialized` after `initialize`
- **Status**: FIXED in edgar-mcp-client.ts
- **Solution**: Proper handshake sequence implemented

### Issue 3: Vercel Deployment
- **Problem**: Can't spawn Docker in serverless
- **Status**: SOLVED with HTTP bridge approach
- **Solution**: Deploy MCP to Railway, call via HTTP

## üìà Next Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Deploy to Railway (2-3 hours)
1. Create Railway account
2. Deploy HTTP bridge service
3. Configure environment variables
4. Test production endpoints

### Priority 2: Vercel Client (3-4 hours)
1. Create `packages/edgar-client`
2. Implement HTTP client with fallback
3. Add retry and caching logic
4. Write tests

### Priority 3: Query Orchestration (4-5 hours)
1. Create classification system
2. Build routing logic
3. Test with sample queries

## üìù Environment Variables Needed

### For Railway Deployment:
```env
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=EdgarAnswerEngine/1.0 (your-email@example.com)
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
API_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
```

### For Vercel App:
```env
EDGAR_MCP_SERVER_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
EDGAR_MCP_API_KEY=<same-secure-key>
DATABASE_URL=<neon-connection-string>
REDIS_URL=<upstash-connection-string>
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Phase 2.1

- [ ] HTTP bridge deployed to Railway and accessible
- [ ] Vercel app can call MCP tools via HTTP
- [ ] Fallback to direct SEC API working
- [ ] Query classification routing correctly
- [ ] Basic thematic search operational
- [ ] All validation gates passing
- [ ] Production monitoring active

## üí° Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with Railway deployment** - Everything else depends on this
2. **Use existing test files** - They validate the integration
3. **Check git status** - Last commit captured all HTTP bridge work
4. **Reference the roadmap** - `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` has full details
5. **Test incrementally** - Verify each component before moving on
