## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Status

### Current Stack
```
Browser → Next.js (Vercel) → Query Orchestrator → EDGAR Client → MCP Bridge (Railway) → SEC APIs
                                    ↓                    ↓
                            Pattern Classification   Fallback to Direct SEC API
```

## 🎯 Current Capabilities vs. Limitations

### ✅ What's Working Now
- **Company Queries**: "Apple's latest 10-K" → Finds and returns filing metadata
- **Query Classification**: Accurately identifies company/thematic/hybrid patterns
- **Entity Recognition**: Extracts companies, tickers, forms, dates from queries
- **SEC Compliance**: Rate limiting and proper User-Agent headers
- **Production Infrastructure**: Full deployment pipeline operational

### ❌ What's Not Yet Implemented
- **Content Extraction**: Cannot parse actual filing text (needs sectionizers)
- **Answer Generation**: No LLM-generated responses with evidence
- **Thematic Queries**: "All companies mentioning AI" not yet functional
- **Citations**: Cannot provide document excerpts with source links
- **Chat Interface**: No user-facing UI yet

## 📋 Priority Task List

### 1. Build Thematic Search Tools (Critical Path)
```typescript
// Location: packages/thematic-search/
bulkFilingDiscovery(): Cross-company filing discovery
crossDocumentSearch(): Content search across multiple filings
```

### 2. Integrate API Routes
```typescript
// Location: apps/web/app/api/chat/route.ts
- Wire orchestrator to chat endpoint
- Add streaming response support
- Implement citation formatting
```

### 3. Implement Sectionizers (Phase 3)
```typescript
// Parse filing content into searchable sections
- 10-K/10-Q item extraction
- 8-K event categorization
- MD&A and Risk Factors parsing
```

### 4. Build RAG Pipeline (Phase 4)
```typescript
// Generate intelligent answers with evidence
- Chunk documents for embeddings
- Vector similarity search
- LLM answer composition with citations
```
