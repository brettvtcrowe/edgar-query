# EDGAR Answer Engine - Evidence-First Query Capabilities

## Overview

The EDGAR Answer Engine provides institutional-grade analysis capabilities through evidence-first query processing. Every response is backed by verifiable citations, hash-verified evidence, and domain-specific expertise, making it suitable for professional financial analysis, regulatory compliance, and academic research.

## 🎯 Evidence-First Query Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Every claim backed by evidence**: Specific filing, section, character offset
- **Zero speculation**: No evidence = no claim; system refuses unsupported statements  
- **Hash-verified citations**: All evidence cross-checked against official SEC text
- **Deterministic execution**: LLM plans → tools execute → LLM composes from evidence
- **Domain expertise**: Form-specific parsing, accounting lexicon, event correlation

## 🚀 Institutional-Grade Query Capabilities

### 1. Company-Specific Financial Analysis
**Performance**: <3 seconds with XBRL verification  
**Evidence Level**: Hash-verified with numeric cross-validation

#### Basic Financial Queries
```
"What was Apple's revenue last quarter?"
→ discover_filings(cik="AAPL", form="10-Q", latest=true)
→ extract_numeric_facts(metric="revenue", period="quarterly")
→ verify_against_xbrl(revenue_figure)
→ Evidence: 10-Q filing, specific XBRL tag, narrative confirmation
```

#### Risk Factor Analysis
```
"What are Tesla's main risk factors in their latest 10-K?"
→ discover_filings(cik="TSLA", form="10-K", latest=true)
→ sectionize_10k(sections=["Item_1A"])
→ extract_risk_categories(section="risk_factors")
→ Evidence: 10-K Item 1A text with exact offsets and categorization
```

#### Performance Metrics Analysis
```
"How does Microsoft describe their segment performance?"
→ discover_filings(cik="MSFT", form="10-K", latest=true)
→ sectionize_10k(sections=["Item_8", "MD&A"])
→ extract_segment_data(include_narrative=true)
→ Evidence: Financial statements + MD&A discussion with segment breakdowns
```

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Analysis
**Performance**: <15 seconds for complex correlation  
**Evidence Level**: Full verification with regulatory cross-referencing

#### Restatement Detection & Analysis
```
"Find all 8-K Item 4.02 restatements related to ASC 606 principal vs agent issues (3 years)"
→ discover_filings(form="8-K", items=["4.02"], date_range="3y")
→ hybrid_search(terms=["revenue recognition", "principal vs agent", "ASC 606"])
→ detect_accounting_events(asc_topics=["ASC_606"])
→ extract_restatement_reasons(confidence_min=0.8)
→ tabulate_results(columns=["company", "date", "reason", "filing_url", "evidence_offset"])

Expected Output:
| Company | Date | Reason | Filing URL | Evidence |
|---------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| ABC Corp | 2024-03-15 | ASC 606 principal vs agent determination | SEC link | Hash-verified text excerpt |
