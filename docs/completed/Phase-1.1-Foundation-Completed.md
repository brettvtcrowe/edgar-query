# Phase 1.1 - Foundation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

**Completion Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Status**: All validation gates passed ‚úÖ  

---

## üéØ Phase Overview

Phase 1.1 established the foundational infrastructure for the EDGAR Answer Engine. The goal was to create a robust, scalable, and production-ready foundation that can support the entire application architecture without requiring future rebuilds.

**Core Principle**: *Build once, never rebuild*

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Monorepo Structure & Project Setup**
**Why**: Organized codebase structure is critical for maintainability and scalability as the project grows across multiple services and packages.

**What we built**:
- Turbo-powered monorepo with optimized build orchestration
- Clear separation: `apps/`, `services/`, `packages/`, `infra/`
- Next.js 14 web application with App Router
- MCP server scaffold for EDGAR data tools
- Shared TypeScript types package with Zod validation

**Technical decisions**:
- **Turbo**: Chosen for its excellent monorepo build caching and parallel execution
- **Next.js 14**: Latest stable version with App Router for modern React patterns
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the entire stack
- **Zod**: Runtime validation and type inference for API contracts

---

### 2. **Git Repository & Version Control**
**Why**: Proper version control and deployment pipeline are essential for collaborative development and reliable deployments.

**What we built**:
- Clean Git repository structure with organized documentation
- Conventional commit messages for clear change tracking
- Documentation organized in `docs/` folder for maintainability
- Development tooling moved to `docs/dev-tools/` for clean root directory

**Key decisions**:
- **Conventional commits**: Enables automated changelog generation and semantic versioning
- **Documentation organization**: Separate from code for better navigation and maintenance
- **Clean root directory**: Professional appearance and easier navigation

---

### 3. **Vercel Deployment & CI/CD**
**Why**: Reliable deployment pipeline ensures consistent delivery and eliminates manual deployment errors.

**What we built**:
- Vercel project linked to GitHub repository
- Automated deployments on push to main branch
- Node.js 20.x runtime for optimal performance
- Monorepo-aware build configuration
- Environment variable management for different environments

**Configuration challenges solved**:
- **Monorepo root directory**: Set to `apps/web` for correct build context
- **Build commands**: Integrated Prisma client generation into build pipeline
- **Environment variables**: Separate management for local and production environments

**Live endpoints**:
- **Production**: https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app/
- **Health Check**: https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app/api/health
- **Hello API**: https://edgar-query-nu.vercel.app/api/hello

---

### 4. **PostgreSQL Database with pgvector**
**Why**: Vector database capabilities are essential for the RAG pipeline, and PostgreSQL with pgvector provides production-ready vector similarity search.

**What we built**:
- Neon PostgreSQL 16 instance with pgvector extension
- Complete database schema designed for EDGAR data:
  - `companies` - Company information with CIK identifiers
  - `filings` - SEC filing metadata and relationships  
  - `sections` - Parsed document sections
  - `chunks` - Text chunks with vector embeddings (1536-dimensional)
  - `answers` - Query responses with source citations
- Prisma ORM with type-safe database client
- Database connection pooling and health monitoring

**Technical decisions**:
- **Neon**: Managed PostgreSQL with excellent pgvector support and serverless scaling
- **pgvector extension**: Industry-standard vector similarity search for embeddings
- **Prisma**: Type-safe database client with excellent TypeScript integration
- **1536-dimensional vectors**: Compatible with OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model

**Schema design rationale**:
- **Normalized relationships**: Proper foreign keys for data integrity
- **Vector column**: Unsupported type declaration for pgvector compatibility
- **Audit fields**: Created/updated timestamps for all entities
- **Cascading deletes**: Maintain referential integrity
- **Cross-document queries**: Schema supports both company-specific and thematic search patterns
- **Bulk operations**: Designed for efficient cross-document discovery and aggregation

---

### 5. **Redis Caching Layer**
**Why**: High-performance caching and rate limiting are crucial for SEC API compliance and application performance.

**What we built**:
- Upstash Redis instance with global distribution
- TLS-encrypted connections for security
- ioredis client with connection pooling
- Health monitoring and connection management
- Rate limiting foundation (implementation in Phase 1.2)

**Technical decisions**:
- **Upstash**: Serverless Redis with global edge network
- **TLS encryption**: Security requirement for production data
- **ioredis**: Production-grade Redis client with clustering support
- **Lazy connections**: Efficient resource usage in serverless environment
- **Multi-pattern caching**: Supports both company-specific and cross-document caching strategies

**Configuration details**:
- Connection string: `redis://default:token@host:6379`
- TLS enabled for secure communication
- Connection pooling for performance
- Retry logic for resilience

---

### 6. **Blob Storage for File Caching**
**Why**: SEC filings are large documents that need efficient caching to avoid repeated downloads and comply with rate limiting.

**What we built**:
- Vercel Blob storage integration
- File caching infrastructure ready for SEC documents
- Health monitoring for storage availability
- Environment variable configuration

**Technical decisions**:
- **Vercel Blob**: Native integration with deployment platform
- **Short TTL caching**: Compliance with SEC guidelines
- **Health checks**: Monitor storage availability without unnecessary usage

---

### 7. **Health Monitoring & Observability**
**Why**: Production applications need comprehensive health monitoring to ensure reliability and quick issue detection.

**What we built**:
- `/api/health` endpoint with comprehensive service checks
- Real-time database connectivity testing
- Redis connection validation
- Blob storage availability checks
- HTTP status codes: 200 (healthy), 503 (degraded), 500 (error)
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

**Health check implementation**:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-08T19:10:11.357Z",
  "environment": "production", 
  "services": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true,
    "blob": true
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```
