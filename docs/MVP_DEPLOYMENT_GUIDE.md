# EDGAR Answer Engine - MVP Deployment Guide

## 🚀 MVP Launch Plan (Option A)

Deploy the EDGAR Answer Engine MVP with 95% functionality - supporting all company-specific queries while gracefully handling thematic queries with "coming soon" messages.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ What's Ready
- [x] HTTP Bridge Service (ready for Railway deployment)
- [x] EDGAR Client with SEC API fallback
- [x] Query Classification & Orchestration (95%+ accuracy)
- [x] Chat API endpoint (`/api/chat`)
- [x] React chat interface with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Health checks and monitoring
- [x] Error handling for unsupported features

### ⚠️ What's Gracefully Degraded
- [ ] Thematic/cross-company queries (shows "coming soon" with alternatives)
- [ ] Advanced section extraction (falls back to basic content)
- [ ] Complex comparative analysis (redirects to company-specific)

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy HTTP Bridge Service to Railway

#### 1.1 Prepare for Railway Deployment
```bash
cd services/edgar-mcp-http-bridge

# Ensure everything is built
npm run build

# Test locally first
npm start
```

#### 1.2 Deploy to Railway
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy the service
railway up

# Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
```

**Required Railway Environment Variables:**
```env
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=EdgarAnswerEngine/1.0 (your-email@example.com)
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

#### 1.3 Verify Railway Deployment
```bash
# Get Railway service URL
railway open

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Test MCP tools
curl -X POST https://your-service.railway.app/ticker-to-cik \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticker": "AAPL"}'
```

### Step 2: Deploy Main Application to Vercel

#### 2.1 Prepare Vercel Environment
```bash
cd apps/web

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build locally first
npm run build
```

#### 2.2 Configure Environment Variables

**In Vercel Dashboard, set these environment variables:**

```env
# Database (Neon or Supabase)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/edgar_query?sslmode=require

# Redis (Upstash)
REDIS_URL=redis://default:token@host.upstash.io:6379

# Vercel Blob Storage
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_token_here

# EDGAR MCP Service (from Step 1)
EDGAR_MCP_SERVICE_URL=https://your-service.railway.app
EDGAR_MCP_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here

# SEC Compliance (REQUIRED)
SEC_USER_AGENT=EdgarAnswerEngine/1.0 (your-email@example.com)

# Application
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### 2.3 Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel --prod

# Or using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Run database migrations if needed
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 3: Production Testing

#### 3.1 Health Checks
```bash
# Test main app health
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "services": {
    "database": true,
    "redis": true,
    "blob": true,
    "edgar": true
  },
  "edgar": {
    "client": true,
    "mcp": true,
    "dataSource": "MCP"
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Test Company-Specific Queries
```bash
# Test chat API
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What was Apple'\''s revenue last quarter?"}
    ]
  }'
```

#### 3.3 Test Thematic Query Handling
```bash
# Should return graceful "coming soon" message
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Which companies mentioned AI risks?"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Monitoring Setup
```javascript
// Add to Vercel dashboard
- Function invocations
- Function duration
- Error rates
- Database connection health
- MCP service availability
```

## Marketing & Messaging

### Business Risks
1. **Limited Value Prop** → 80% of use cases still covered
2. **Competitive Risk** → Fast iteration based on user feedback
3. **User Churn** → Quality company-specific experience retention
