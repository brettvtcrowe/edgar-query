# EDGAR Answer Engine - Critical Fix Tasks

**Status**: SYSTEM BROKEN - Requires immediate fixes for production readiness

## 🚨 Current Problems

1. **Orchestrator selects wrong filings** - Getting 2023 data instead of latest filings
2. **MCP service not connected** - 21 specialized SEC tools unavailable  
3. **Broken content parsing** - Revenue data mangled by poor HTML cleaning
4. **Query intent ignored** - System doesn't match filing types to user questions

## 📋 Detailed Fix Plan

### Task 1: Fix Query-Intent Based Filing Selection
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Problem**: Orchestrator blindly selects filings without understanding query intent
- "Latest revenue" gets 2023 data instead of current quarter
- "Risk factors" doesn't target 10-K forms specifically
- "Leadership changes" doesn't look for 8-K filings

**Solution**: Implement intelligent filing selection logic

#### 1.1 Update Entity Extractor
- Add query intent classification alongside entity extraction
- Map query intent to appropriate filing types:
  ```typescript
  const queryIntents = {
    'revenue': ['10-Q', '10-K'], // Latest financial data
    'earnings': ['10-Q', '8-K'], // Quarterly results + earnings releases  
    'risk_factors': ['10-K'], // Annual comprehensive risk disclosure
    'leadership_changes': ['8-K'], // Current reports for exec changes
    'annual_results': ['10-K'], // Full year comprehensive data
    'quarterly_results': ['10-Q'], // Quarterly data
    'recent_events': ['8-K'] // Material events and changes
  };
  ```

#### 1.2 Enhance Orchestrator Filing Selection
- Modify `createCompanySpecificPlan()` to consider query intent
- Update `executePlan()` filing selection logic:
  ```typescript
  // Instead of: filings.find(f => f.form === '10-K' || f.form === '10-Q')
  // Use: selectFilingsByIntent(filings, queryIntent, userQuery)
  ```

#### 1.3 Add Date-Based Prioritization
- For "latest/recent" queries: prioritize by filing date
- For historical queries: match date ranges
- For comprehensive queries: get most complete filing type

### Task 2: Fix MCP Service Connection (MANDATORY)
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Problem**: Railway MCP service shows `mcp_connection: false`
- 21 specialized SEC analysis tools unavailable
- System falls back to broken SEC parsing instead

**Solution**: Debug and fix Railway MCP deployment

#### 2.1 Debug Railway MCP Service
- Check Railway deployment logs for Python subprocess errors
- Verify MCP server path and execution environment
- Test direct connection to embedded MCP service

#### 2.2 Fix MCP Client Connection Logic
File: `services/edgar-mcp-http-bridge/src/edgar-mcp-client.ts`
- Current issue: Python subprocess failing to start MCP server
- Options:
  - Fix Python module execution path
  - Switch to Node.js-based MCP implementation
  - Use direct HTTP calls to working MCP service

#### 2.3 Verify All 21 MCP Tools Available
Once connected, test critical tools:
- `get_filing_sections` - Extract specific document sections
- `analyze_risk_factors` - Intelligent risk analysis
- `extract_financial_data` - Comprehensive financial metrics
- `detect_leadership_changes` - Executive change analysis
- `get_insider_trading` - Insider transaction data

### Task 3: Remove Broken SEC API Fallback
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Problem**: Custom SEC parsing interferes with proper MCP operation
- HTML cleaning mangles financial data
- Regex patterns miss actual content
- System uses broken fallback instead of proper MCP tools

**Solution**: Clean up fallback code

#### 3.1 Modify EDGAR Client
File: `packages/edgar-client/src/index.ts`
- Remove custom `parseFilingSections()` method (lines 265-363)
- Remove HTML cleaning logic that mangles data
- Restore MCP-first approach with proper error handling

#### 3.2 Update Orchestrator
- Remove SEC fallback logic that bypasses MCP
- Ensure MCP tools are always attempted first
- Only fallback to basic filing metadata (not content parsing)

### Task 4: Test Comprehensive Query Scenarios
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

**Problem**: System only tested with revenue queries
- Need to verify all SEC filing scenarios work properly

**Solution**: Comprehensive testing matrix

#### 4.1 Company-Specific Scenarios
```typescript
const testQueries = [
  // Financial Data
  "What was Apple's revenue last quarter?",
  "Show me Tesla's annual profit margins",
  "Get Microsoft's cash flow statement",
  
  // Risk Analysis  
  "What are Apple's main risk factors?",
  "Show me Tesla's regulatory risks",
  "What cybersecurity risks does Microsoft mention?",
  
  // Corporate Events
  "Find Apple's recent leadership changes",
  "Show me Tesla's recent 8-K filings",
  "What material events has Microsoft disclosed?",
  
  // Business Analysis
  "Describe Apple's business segments",
  "What does Tesla say about competition?",
  "Show me Microsoft's acquisition strategy"
];
```

#### 4.2 Cross-Company (Thematic) Scenarios
```typescript
const thematicQueries = [
  "All companies mentioning AI risks in 2024",
  "Which tech companies disclosed cybersecurity incidents?", 
  "Compare supply chain risks across automotive companies",
  "Find all companies with new CEO appointments this year"
];
```

#### 4.3 Edge Cases
- Companies with no recent filings
- Invalid ticker symbols
- Ambiguous queries requiring clarification
- Very old historical data requests
