## üéØ Overview

EDGAR Answer Engine is a cloud-hosted web application that enables users to ask natural language questions about SEC EDGAR filings and receive accurate, citation-backed answers. Built with Next.js and powered by LLMs with a tool-first architecture, it provides instant access to complex financial data without mirroring SEC databases.

### Key Features

- **üîç Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English about any SEC filing
- **üåê Cross-Company Analysis**: NEW - Search across all companies for thematic patterns
- **üìä Evidence-Grounded Citations**: Every response includes direct links to source documents
- **‚ö° Intelligent Query Routing**: Automatic classification and routing to optimal processing
- **üè¢ Company Intelligence**: Automatic ticker resolution and filing history
- **üìà Multi-Form Support**: Works with 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, S-1, 20-F, comment letters, and more
- **üîó Direct SEC Links**: All citations link directly to official SEC.gov documents
- **‚öôÔ∏è 100% Reliability**: Automatic fallback ensures no query ever fails

### Example Queries

#### Company-Specific Queries (EDGAR MCP)
```
"What were Apple's risk factors in their latest 10-K?"

"Show me Microsoft's quarterly revenue from their last 10-Q"

"Find Tesla's recent 8-K filings about leadership changes"
```

#### Thematic Cross-Company Queries (NEW ‚úÖ)
```
"All companies mentioning artificial intelligence in their latest filings"

"Show me cybersecurity incident disclosures across all sectors"

"Which tech companies discussed supply chain risks in 2024?"
```

"Find all Item 4.02 restatements related to ASC 606 principal vs. agent issues"

"Which life sciences companies use the milestone method for revenue recognition?"
```

> **Full Capabilities**: See [docs/QUERY_CAPABILITIES.md](./docs/QUERY_CAPABILITIES.md) for comprehensive examples and supported query patterns including regulatory compliance analysis, accounting policy tracking, and SEC comment letter searches.

**Core Principles:**
- **Accuracy First**: Every claim backed by retrieved evidence
- **No EDGAR Mirroring**: Fetch on-demand with short TTL caching
- **Tool-First**: LLM orchestrates; tools provide facts
- **Compliance**: Proper User-Agent, rate limiting, backoff
