# /agent-review - Comprehensive Project Review Command

## Description
Launches a comprehensive multi-agent analysis of the entire project, evaluating clarity of purpose, architecture, tech stack, features, and deployment from five expert perspectives.

## Usage
```
/agent-review
```

## Agent Analysis Sequence

This command triggers five specialized agent reviews in parallel:

### 1. Architecture Analysis (architect.md)
**Focus Areas:**

```

### 4. Backend Engineering Analysis (backend.md)
**Focus Areas:**
- API design and RESTful principles
- Data models and database architecture
- Backend service architecture
- Integration with external services (SEC EDGAR API)
- Error handling and resilience patterns
- Performance and optimization strategies

**Agent Prompt:**
