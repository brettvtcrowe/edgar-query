# Force Rebuild Marker

Timestamp: 2025-08-18 22:00:00 UTC

This file forces Vercel to rebuild with latest code.

## Critical Issues Fixed:
- Force direct SEC API usage (no MCP)
- Disable all caching
- Return current 2025 data, not 2023

## Test After Deploy:
NVIDIA should show Form 4 from 2025-08-18, NOT 2023 data!
